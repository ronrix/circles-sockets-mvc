# My own mvc framework


## assets 
	> all static files like images, styles, js are included in here

## connection
	> all databases connection can be created in here, you can also add query builder on your own
	> Mysql, PostGres, etc.
	> add more query builder methods
##### Using mysql
```
	const mysql = require("mysql2");
	const {db_config} = require("../config");
	class Connection {
		constructor() {
			this.connection = mysql.createConnection({
				"host": db_config.server_name,
				"user": db_config.username,
				"password": db_config.password,
				"database": db_config.dbname,
				"port": db_config.port
			});

			this.connection.connect(function(err) {
				if (err) {
					console.log(err);
					return;
				}
				console.log("mysql connection");
			});
		}

		format_query(query, fields) {
			return mysql.format(query, Object.values(fields));
		}
		
	}
```

## controllers
	> all controller files are in here, every file has it's own handling logic which connects views and models
```
	class SampleController {
		constructor() {
			// you can add more models to use on your controller
			this.MyModel = new Model();

			// binding this to use models
			this.methods = this.methods.bind(this);
		}
		methods(req, res) {
			const fields = req.body;
			this.MyModel.login(fields);
		}
	}
```
	> you have to bind this to use your models

# models
	> all business logic or databases logic are here to be called by the controller, you can add more models that handles different tables and add logic here
##### example using mysql
```
const Connection = require("../connection/Connection");

class HomeModel extends Connection {
	constructor() {
		super();
	}
	
	login(fields) {

		const query = this.format_query(`
		SELECT users.id, users.first_name, users.email, users.password
		FROM users
		WHERE users.email = ? AND users.password = ? LIMIT 1;`, fields);

		return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
			this.connection.query(query, (err, result) => {

				if(err) {
					throw err;
					return;
				}

				if(result.length === 0) {
					reject("No user found!");
				}
				else {
					resolve(result);
				}
			});
		});
	}
}
